Package contracts implements the main network contracts.

Contracts play a central role in Kowala - the state of all accounts is the state
of the Kowala network which is updated with every block.
The Kowala dev team is currently focused and actively improving contracts
concerned with the consensus validation, price stabilisation and rewards.


Smart Contracts

The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a
vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and
wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin
into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, driverâ€™s license, or
whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts not only define the
rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional
contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations.


Smart contracts can:

* Function as 'multi-signature' accounts, so that funds are spent only when a
required percentage of people agree.
* Manage agreements between users, say, if one buys insurance from the other.
* Store information about an application, such as domain registration
information or membership records (Ex: consensus validators).
