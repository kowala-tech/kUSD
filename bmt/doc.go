Package bmt provides a binary merkle tree implementation

Kowala & Binary Merkle Tree

The current codebase is currently not using this package since we have not
included the non-core protocols (swarm, whisper) yet. We are probably going to
use this package to provide compact inclusion proofs to prove that the block
fragments sent during a consensus election round are part of the proposed block.


Binary Merkle Tree Hash

Hash function over arbitrary datachunks of limited size.
It is defined as the root hash of the binary merkle tree built over fixed
size segments of the underlying chunk using any base hash function (e.g keccak
256 SHA3).

It is used as the chunk hash function in swarm which in turn is the basis for
the 128 branching swarm hash.

The BMT is optimal for providing compact inclusion proofs, i.e. prove that a
segment is a substring of a chunk starting at a particular offset The size of
the underlying segments is fixed at 32 bytes (called the resolution of the BMT
hash), the EVM word size to optimize for on-chain BMT verification as well as
the hash size optimal for inclusion proofs in the merkle tree of the swarm hash.

Two implementations are provided:

* RefHasher is optimized for code simplicity and meant as a reference
implementation.

* Hasher is optimized for speed taking advantage of concurrency with
minimalistic  control structure to coordinate the concurrent routines  It
implements the ChunkHash interface as well as the go standard hash.Hash
interface.
