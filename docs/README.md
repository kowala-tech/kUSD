# Kowala Docs

Kowala Documentation generated by MkDocs. The documentation is automatically pushed to the following URLs using the CI server:

| URL                      | Branch    | Purpose                                                  | 
|--------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| https://docs.kowala.tech | `master`  | Public documentation for the kcoin ecosystem             |
| https://docs.kowala.io   | `develop` | Documentation for internal review or unreleased features |

Note: both servers are behind an AWS CloudFront cache which is automatically invalidated on commit to `master` and `develop`. That means it will take a minute or two for changes to propagate on the servers.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ make
```

## Contribution

Changes should be submitted according to their size and category:

- Typo fixes, small corrections and alterations _that don't change how users understand the software_ should be pushed to `develop`
- Major structual changes, significant rewrites or fundamental changes to the operation of the software from the user's perspective should take the form of a pull request to `develop`.

The `master` branch is locked, and requires an approved pull request in order to be merged.
