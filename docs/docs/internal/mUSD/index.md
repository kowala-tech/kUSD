# Overview

Kowala's mUSD token is a capped digital asset that is going to be used in the mining process and other activities to be defined.
Kowala has a set of early investors that acquired mUSD tokens and that should be guided during the whole process of token generation. Here we describe the process of token creation and distribuiton. We start by addressing the major challenges that the Ethereum community is facing with token standards. The current standard, ERC20, has too many flaws such as the lost token problem. We then explain the process that leads to the token contract creation and as soon as the contract is in place we move on to the minting process which is a once in a lifetime event that distributes tokens to specific addresses provided by the investors.
