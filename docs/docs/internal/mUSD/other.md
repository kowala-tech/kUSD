## Airdrops

* We need to take into consideration that the consensus contract has a minimum price required (in mUSD) per participation and airdrops will probably not provide enough balance for users to join the consensus. In order to mitigate this problem we could think about token delegation, although, different parties could get to an agreement by themselves without Kowala's help. The cosmos team is implementing something like this idea: https://cosmos.network/resources/delegators.
