# Official networks

Kowala maintains three persistent networks, two of which are publically
accessible.

kUSD is the flagship kcoin currency, and our only main, or production, network.
The testnet, branded as Zygote, is a production-ready environment that can be
used for the development of applications, and it's where we test main net
releases. The internal devnet is a highly unstable environment where we try out
cutting-edge code and all sorts of other stuff that doesn't work.
