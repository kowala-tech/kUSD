/*
Package console implements an interactive javascript running environment

The current implementation of the console relies on the Ethereum Javascript
framework (web3) for apis that are covered in it and also on extensions to the
same framework available at internal/web3ext. Note that any update to the
backend must involve also some updates to either web3 or the extensions.


Interactive Use - Console

Once you have the kusd client installed, using the console is merely a case of
executing the "kusd your_config console" command in a terminal - the console
displays the available modules upon start.


Non-Interactive Use

It's also possible to execute files in the Javascript interpreter. The "console"
and "attach" subcommand accept the "--exec" argument which is a javascript
statement.


Limitations

Kowala JSRE uses the Otto VM which has some limitations:

* "use strict" will parse, but does nothing.
* The regular expression engine (re2/regexp) is not fully compatible with the
ECMA5 specification.


Kowala

* We've replaced the miner module with the validator module - contains
additional methods such as setDeposit.
