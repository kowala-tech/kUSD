Package accounts manages wallets and its account(s).

Here we focus on externally owned accounts which are usually referred to as
accounts - think bank account. Accounts play a central role in Kowala - the
state of all accounts is the state of the Kowala network which is updated with
every block. The accounts package also includes the ABI package - defines the
structures and methods that you will use to interact with a binary contract.

Account

Accounts are essential for users to interact with the Kowala blockchain via
transactions. There are two types of accounts: externally owned accounts and
contract accounts - accounts have balance and contracts have both balance and
contract storage. Externally owned accounts are usually refererred to as
accounts and contract accounts as contracts - contracts are covered in the
contracts package. Accounts are used, for example, to sign transactions so that
the EVM can securely validate the identity of a transaction sender.


Account Address & Keyfiles

Every account is defined by a pair of keys, a private key and a public key.
Accounts are indexed by their address which is derived from the public key that
defines the account. Every private key(encrypted)/address pair is encoded in a
keyfile - JSON text file that can be found in the keystore subdirectory of your
Kowala's node data directory (default: .kowala/keystore). Make sure you backup
your keyfiles regularly!


Creating an account

Once you have the kusd client installed, creating an account is merely a case of
executing the "kusd account new" command in a terminal.


Wallet

A wallet represents a software or hardware wallet that might contain one or more
accounts (derived from the same seed). The current codebase (1.73) supports the
following hardware wallets: Ledger Blue & Ledger Nano S.


Application Binary Interface (/abi)

A Kowala smart contract is bytecode deployed on the Kowala blockchain. There
could be several functions in a contract. An ABI is necessary so that you can
specify which function in the contract to invoke, as well as get a guarantee
that the function will return data in the format you are expecting.
