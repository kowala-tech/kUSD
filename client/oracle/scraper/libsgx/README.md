# oracle-sgx

The most compelling applications of smart contracts – such as financial instruments – require access to data about real-world state and events, and smart contracts lack network access. Oracles aim to meet this need. The end goal of Kowala's authenticated data feed system is to incentivize any network user to provide the exchange prices in a decentralized and timely manner in order to keep the coin stable in return of rewards. This repository represents the official implementation of Kowala's authenticated data feed system.
